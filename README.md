## Introduction

Welcome to Flutter Boilerplate, your all-in-one companion for creating awesome Flutter projects with ease! Whether you're starting a new project or need to jump-start development on your next brilliant idea, Flutter Boilerplate has got your back. Say goodbye to tedious repetitive setup tasks and hello to a smooth, delightful development experience.

### But Wait, There's More!

Flutter Boilerplate isn't just another mundane extension. It's a Swiss Army Knife for Flutter projects! We've assembled a collection of useful tools and utilities inside the `utils`, `providers`, and `widgets` folders, so you can focus on building incredible apps rather than wasting time on boilerplate code.

## Features

- **utils** folder:
  - 🧵 **Strings File**: Automatically generate a strings file with commonly used strings.
  - 🎨 **Colors File**: Create an app colors file to keep your palette in perfect harmony.
  - 📱 **Responsive Layout**: Get a head start with a layout builder widget for multiple screen sizes.
  - 📦 **Constants**: Store your constant functions and variables in one convenient file.
  - 💅 **Styles**: Organize your textstyles, buttonstyles, and more in a dedicated styles file.
  - 🖼️ **Assets**: Easily manage your image and SVG asset paths.

- **providers** folder:
  - 🤝 **Common Provider Boilerplate**: Kickstart your app's state management with ease.

- **widgets** folder:
  - 🚀 **AppBar Widget**: Quickly generate an AppBar widget for your Flutter app.

- **screens** folder:
  - 🏠 **Homepage Widget**: Enjoy a ready-to-use homepage stateful widget for quick development.

## Getting Started

Flutter Boilerplate is easy to install and use. Here's how you can get started:

1. Install the Extension:
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac).
   - Search for "Flutter Boilerplate" and click "Install."

2. Run the Command:
   - Open your Flutter project in Visual Studio Code.
   - Make sure that the lib folder has been generated (crucial step)
   - Press `F1` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the Command Palette.
   - Type "Generate Boilerplate" and select the command when it appears in the list.

That's it! The extension will work its magic, generating the necessary files and folders inside the `lib` folder of your Flutter project, including the `utils`, `providers`, `widgets`, and `screens` folders with the corresponding boilerplate code.
