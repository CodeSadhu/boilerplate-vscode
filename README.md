## Introduction

Welcome to Startify, your all-in-one companion for creating awesome Flutter projects with ease! Whether you're starting a new project or need to jump-start development on your next brilliant idea, Startify has got your back. Say goodbye to tedious repetitive setup tasks and hello to a smooth, delightful development experience.

Startify isn't just another mundane extension. It's a Swiss Army Knife for Flutter projects! We've assembled a collection of useful tools and utilities inside the `utils` and `services` folder, so you can focus on building incredible apps rather than wasting time on boilerplate code.

## Getting Started

Startify is easy to install and use. Here's how you can get started:

1. Install the Extension:
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac).
   - Search for "Startify" and click "Install."

2. Run the Command:
   - Open your Flutter project in Visual Studio Code.
   - Make sure that the lib folder has been generated (crucial step)
   - Press `F1` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the Command Palette.
   - Type "Startify: Generate Startify" and select the command when it appears in the list.

That's it! The extension will work its magic, generating the necessary files and folders inside the `lib` folder of your Flutter project with the corresponding boilerplate code.
